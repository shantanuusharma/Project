DESCRIPTION -

Snake is a little yet popular game where you have to catch as many stars as possible with your snake. This game is well-known on the nokia mobile phones, but I wrote my own version for the terminal.

The game starts of with an interactive menu which gives the user options such as to start a new game, to see the controls.The game then allows you to control the speed and the game starts then.

The game uses an array to monitor the movements of the snake and further details about the working of the programme are given in the .jpeg file.As their is only one file (snake.c) and one header file (snake.h) the second part of the .jpeg as mentioned on the college website is not drawn.I have also put some art to make the game interactive such as the welcome screen and the gameover screen.

I have included 2 video files ( snake.ogv (size - 3.1mb) , final.ogv (size - 11mb) ).

The 2 video files shows the demo of the game in progress.They shows some of the levels which gives you the idea of the different speed which uses the system clock.You can clearly see the difference in speeds as it approaches to 9.The pause button is also incorporated by pressing P/ESC in video 2(I have given the second video file an extension of .mp4 (originally .ogv))

I would also like to mention that the main challenge of this code was to move the snake which took me a while and help of my college seniors and my Data structures lab instructor for giving me the idea of using a blank ' ' character for moving the snake forward.
