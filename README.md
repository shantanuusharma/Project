Snake is a little yet popular game where you have to catch as many stars as possible with your snake. This game is well-known on the nokia mobile phones, but I wrote my own version for the terminal.

The game starts of with an interactive menu which gives the user options such as to start a new game, to see the controls etc.The game then allows you to control the speed and the game starts then.

The game uses an array to monitor the movements of the snake and further details about the data structure are given in the .jpeg file.
I have also put some art to make the game interactive which is not created by me.

Also I would like to mention that the main challenge of this code was to move the snake which took me a while.

A video is also included which shows the demo of the game in progress.
